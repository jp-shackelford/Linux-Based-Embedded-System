Lab 2 - EE 474
This lab utilizes the GPIO pins of the BBB in order to drive an <br /> 
lcd display as well as test for jitter of the GPIO pins.<br /> 
<br />
<br /> 
To Compile run command <br />
$make lcd
<br />
There are three main stages to this lab<br /> 
1. Running oscilloscope test, run command:<br />
$./o
2. Running guessing game, run command:<br />
$./g
3. Running front and back pipes, run commands in two different terminals:<br />
TERMINAL 1 <br />
$./f<br />
TERMINAL 2 <br />
$./b<br />
For more descriptions of how these programs work, read the lab report
documentation found under Group6/Lab2/Lab2_Report.pdf 
Lab 1 - EE 474
This lab utilizes the beaglebone black device's PWM and GPIO pins
to count upwards to seven in binary repeatedly on three LEDS as
well as use the PWM to generate musical frequencies to a speaker
